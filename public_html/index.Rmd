This site describes a plan to develop and provide services for a Lake District Bike Network (LDBN). Our research and analysis has identified a series of interventions in the area, including a bicycle hire network, that will reduce congestion and greatly enhance opportunities for outdoor tourism and leisure.

Here's our overview map of the proposal:

The main elements of the plan, and service we will provide if this is funded, are:

- A network of cycle hire points that will build on the emerging cycle rental industry in the area and nationally, led by organisations such as [BikePlus](http://www.carplus.org.uk/projects/bikeplus/)
- Provision of digital tools to assist wayfinding and transport information to visitors
- Tools for transport planners to help development and management of the network


This represent a comprehensive suite of measures to reduce barriers to cycling in the Lake District, main element of which is the bike hire network.
